We have built NN models for transformer S-parameter prediction.

(Mainly 4 types of models: MLP, CNN, U-net, and Graph Transformer)

The dataset is on our rdf server.

"1_1_models" contains the notebkooks for 1:1 transformers

"Size&Accuracy" contains experiments for how the accuracy scales with neural network sizes for MLP models and U-net models.

"Samples&Accuracy" contains experiments for how the accuaracy scales with number of samples in training dataset.

"M_N_models" contains the notebooks for M;N transformers
